# SIEMEz
SIEMEz is a truely free security solution that allows anyone the ability to deploy their own Security Incident and Event Management System.

# Purpose
While there are a number of SIEM solutions available, many require enterprise licensing to utilise effectively.
The annoyance of requiring an enterprise license for user management, or even dashboarding has led me (the developer) to create this project.
